= SkipArchives Windup Ruleset

Identifies the archives (notably .jar files) from analyzed application
and marks the well known libraries not worth further analyzing to be skipped by other rulesets.

The archives are identified by their SHA1 checksum.
Mappings of these checksums to Maven's G:A:V are distributed within the ruleset's addon.
Further mapping can be added to `~/.windup/config/SkipArch`.

Further, this ruleset offers an operation to configure Windup to skip user-specified artifacts.


See https://github.com/cstamas/maven-indexer-examples[Maven indexer examples] for details.

This quickstart demonstrates advanced ruleset authoring with interacting rules and an external dependency.
