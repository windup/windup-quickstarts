Summary: Windup Java rule addon that reports on use of the Seam Asynchronous annotation in remote EJBs +
https://github.com/windup/windup-quickstarts/ +

[[what-is-it]]
== What is it?

The Seam `@Asynchronous` annotation is not compatible with remote EJBs in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 
This Java rule addon tests for for use of `org.jboss.seam.annotations.async.Asynchronous` annotations in remote EJBs and reports that it must be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 `@Asynchronous` annotation.

[[review-the-quickstart-code]]
== Review the Quickstart Code

The `EjbBeanUtilsAsyncUsageRuleProvider` class extends `RuleProvider` and overrides the following methods:

* `getConfiguration(GraphContext context)`: This method looks for annotations named "com.beanutils.async.AsynchronousMethod". 
When found, it adds the following text to the report and points the person to the JBoss EAP 6 documentation: 
+
"`REMOTE_EJB_CLASS_NAME` uses the Seam @Asynchronous annotation. It is not compatible with JBoss EAP Remote EJBs and should be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 @Asynchronous annotation."

[[system-requirements]]
