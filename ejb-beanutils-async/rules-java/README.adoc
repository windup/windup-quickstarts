Author: Jess Sightler + 
Level: Intermediate +
Summary: Windup Java rule add-on that reports on use of the Seam Asynchronous annotation in remote EJBs +
https://github.com/windup/windup-quickstarts/ +

[[what-is-it]]
== What is it?

The Seam `@Asynchronous` annotation is not compatible with remote EJBs in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 
This Java rule add-on tests for for use of `org.jboss.seam.annotations.async.Asynchronous` annotations in remote EJBs and reports that it must be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 `@Asynchronous` annotation.

These instructions use the following replaceable variables. 

* `WINDUP-HOME`: Replace this variable with the fully qualified path to your Windup installation.
* `QUICKSTART_HOME`: Replace this variable with the fully qualified path to the root directory of this quickstart.

[[review-the-quickstart-code]]
== Review the Quickstart Code

The `EjbBeanUtilsAsyncUsageRuleProvider` class extends `AbstractRuleProvider` and overrides the `getConfiguration(GraphContext context)` method.
 
This method looks for annotations named "com.beanutils.async.AsynchronousMethod". 
When found, it adds the following text to the report and points the person to the JBoss EAP 6 documentation: 
....
`REMOTE_EJB_CLASS_NAME` uses the Seam @Asynchronous annotation. It is not compatible with JBoss EAP Remote EJBs and should be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 @Asynchronous annotation.
....
