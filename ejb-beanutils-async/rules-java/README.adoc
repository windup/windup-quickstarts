Summary: Windup Java rule add-on that reports on use of the Seam Asynchronous annotation in remote EJBs +
https://github.com/windup/windup-quickstarts/ +

[[what-is-it]]
== What is it?

The Seam `@Asynchronous` annotation is not compatible with remote EJBs in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 
This Java rule add-on tests for for use of `org.jboss.seam.annotations.async.Asynchronous` annotations in remote EJBs and reports that it must be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 `@Asynchronous` annotation.

[[review-the-quickstart-code]]
== Review the Quickstart Code

The `EjbBeanUtilsAsyncUsageRuleProvider` class extends `RuleProvider` and overrides the following methods:

* `getConfiguration(GraphContext context)`: This method looks for annotations named "com.beanutils.async.AsynchronousMethod". 
When found, it adds the following text to the report and points the person to the JBoss EAP 6 documentation: 
+
"`REMOTE_EJB_CLASS_NAME` uses the Seam @Asynchronous annotation. It is not compatible with JBoss EAP Remote EJBs and should be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 @Asynchronous annotation."

[[system-requirements]]
== System requirements

== Build and Install the Quickstart as a Windup Add-on in One Simple Step

This is the easiest and fastest way to build the quickstart, install it into the local Maven repository, and install it into Windup as a rule add-on.

. If you have not started Windup, follow the instructions above to link:#start-windup[Start Windup].
. Build the quickstart and install the add-on in Windup using the `addon-build-and-install` command in the Windup console.
* The command uses the following syntax, where `QUICKSTART_HOME` refers the root directory of this `ejb-beanutils-async` quickstart:
+
----
addon-build-and-install --projectRoot QUICKSTART_HOME/rules-java  
----
+
For example:
+
----
addon-build-and-install --projectRoot /home/username/windup-quickstarts/ejb-beanutils-async/rules-java
----
