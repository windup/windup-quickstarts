[[what-is-it]]
== What is it?

WebLogic provides its own proprietary servlet and filter annotations for dependency injection. 
If the application uses them, they must be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 annotations. 
These examples demonstrates how to create a Windup rule add-on that searches for these proprietary annotations and reports on them.

The rule searches for the following annotations:

* _@WLServlet_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebServlet_ annotation.
* _@WLFilter_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebFilter_ annotation.
* _@WLInitParam_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebInitParam_ annotation.

You can create Winupup rule add-ons using Java or XML. This quickstart provides examples of both types of rules.
