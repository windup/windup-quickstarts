Summary: Windup Java-based rule add-on that reports on WebLogic servlet annotations +
Source: https://github.com/windup/windup-quickstarts/ +

[[what-is-it]]
== What is it?

WebLogic provides its own proprietary servlet and filter annotations for dependency injection. 
If the application uses them, they must be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 annotations. 
This example demonstrates how to create a RuleProvider that searches for these proprietary annotations and reports on them.

This Java-based Windup rule add-on searches for the following annotations:

* _@WLServlet_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebServlet_ annotation.
* _@WLFilter_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebFilter_ annotation.
* _@WLInitParam_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebInitParam_ annotation.

== Review the Quickstart Code

The _MyHintsRuleProvider_ class extends _RuleProvider_ and overrides the following methods:

* `getExecuteAfter()`: Nothing executes after this, so this method returns an empty list.
* `enhanceMetadata(Context context)`: This method specifies additional metadata about the Rule instances originating from this RuleProvider.
* `getConfiguration(GraphContext context)`: This method does the following.
* Adds a rule that looks for `weblogic.servlet.annotation.WLServlet` annotations. If found:
** Classifies the annotation as "WebLogic @WLServlet" and provides a link to the Java EE `javax.servlet.annotation` package Javadoc.
** Provides a warning text telling the user to replace the proprietary WebLogic @WLServlet annotation with the Java EE 6 standard @WebServlet annotation and provides a link to an article on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
** Assigns 1 story point of effort to this task.
* Adds a rule that looks for `weblogic.servlet.annotation.WLInitParam` annotations. If found:
** Classifies the annotation as "WebLogic @WLInitParam" and provides a link to the Java EE `javax.servlet.annotation` package Javadoc.
** Provides a warning text telling the user to replace the proprietary WebLogic @WLInitParam annotation with the Java EE 6 standard @WebInitParam annotation and provides a link to an article on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
** Assigns 2 story points of effort to this task.
* Adds a rule that looks for `weblogic.servlet.annotation.WLFilter` annotations. If found:
** Classifies the annotation as "WebLogic @WLFilter" and provides a link to the Java EE `javax.servlet.annotation` package Javadoc.
** Provides a warning text telling the user to replace the proprietary WebLogic @WLFilter annotation with the Java EE 6 standard @WebFilter annotation and provides a link to an article on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
** Assigns 3 story points of effort to this task.

[[add-the-quickstart-to-windup]]
== Add the Quickstart to Windup

There are 2 ways to add the quickstart to Windup.

* link:#build-and-install-the-quickstart-as-a-windup-add-on-in-one-simple-step[Build and Install the Quickstart as a Windup Add-on in One Simple Step]: 
You can build and install the quickstart into the Maven repository and install it into Windup using one command.This is the fastest way to install a rule add-on into Windup.
* link:#build-and-install-the-quickstart-as-a-windup-add-on-in-two-separate-steps[Build and Install the Quickstart as a Windup Add-on in Two Separate Steps]: 
You can use a Maven command to build and install the quickstart into the Maven repository and a separate Windup command to install it into Windup.

[[build-and-install-the-quickstart-as-a-windup-add-on-in-one-simple-step]]
== Build and Install the Quickstart as a Windup Add-on in One Simple Step

This is the easiest and fastest way to build the quickstart, install it
into the local Maven repository, and install it into Windup as a rule add-on.

. If you have not started Windup, follow the instructions above to link:#start-windup[Start Windup].
. Build the quickstart and install the add-on in Windup using the `addon-build-and-install` command in the Windup console.
* The command uses the following syntax, where `QUICKSTART_HOME` refers the root directory of this `weblogic-javaee-servlet` quickstart:
+
----
addon-build-and-install --projectRoot QUICKSTART_HOME/rules-java  
----
+
For example:
+
----
addon-build-and-install --projectRoot /home/username/windup-quickstarts/weblogic-javaee-servlet/rules-java  
----
+
* You should see the following result.
+
----
***SUCCESS*** Addon org.jboss.windup.quickstarts:windup-weblogic-javaee-servlet:::2.0.0.Final was installed successfully.
